Short notes on the terms used in the application:
What is Bookie?
An social media inspired approach / multi tenant application for Rental companies where some users can be members of n organizations.

User:
A User is a plain user that has connections to one or more companies / customer groups.

It can also be a customer on it's own without having to be in a Customer group.


A Tenant:
The term tenant is used to situate a grouping of users but that is not really a group.

It's more of a logical container for putting groups / users within where the owner of all the resources is the Tenant.


So a URL like http://randomdomain.tld/g,{group} resolves down to a Tenant of {group} in the URL. 
Menu's are always generated out based on the current Tenant in the URL
